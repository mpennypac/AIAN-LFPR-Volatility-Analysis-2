            Basic CPS Microdata Files and FERRETT Access 

                           May 2004 Forward

Release of these files was delayed by the changeover to new geography based on the results of the 2000 Decennial Census.  
Starting in May, the geographic definitions used to identify substate areas were changed to reflect those defined by the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as of June 30, 2003.  See OMB Bulletin No. 03-04 for details of these revisions.  
Users need to review their programs prior to accessing any substate geography to insure that their queries are consistent 
with the new definitions.  This revision, necessitated by the introduction of a new sample based on the results of the 
2000 Decennial Census, will cause breaks in most time series analysis using substate geography.  This note applies to 
individuals accessing both the ftp site or using the FERRETT access system.  If you are downloading files through the 
ftp site, be sure to download the revised documentation also.  A geographic attachment detailing all the substate codes 
available is provided as part of the documentation.  This attachment will also be useful to individuals accessing 
geographic data through the FERRETT system as it provides some necessary notes and details that will make accessing the 
data more accurate and reliable.

Contact Greg Weyland on 301 763-3790 if you have any questions about the details of the changeover to new geographic 
codes or how to properly use these codes on any of the FERRETT ftp files.

Haven-Stamford CNECTA (using the NECTA definitions).  They are coded on the public use file in the GTCSA field as being 
in the Bridgeport-New Haven-Stamford  CNECTA.  If you want to add them to the New York City CSA, you'll need to add them 
in using the appropriate GTCBSA codes.



                 List 3: Individual Principal Cities

Please Note: You must use the CBSA code in combination with the city code 
to uniquely identify principal cities.  If a county name is provided, you must 
incorporate the county code into any algorithm used to tabulate a specific 
city's characteristics.  The same applies to state codes for multi-state CBSA's.
